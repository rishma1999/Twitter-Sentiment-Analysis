# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

It is a project that uses Twitter API and textblob module in order to parse tweets fetched from Twitter and apply sentiment analysis on the tweets. 
This project allows us to search for tweets using any keyword, language and location according to a particular latitude, longitude or worldwide and returns the desired amount of tweets along with their sentiment which is classified into positive, negative and neutral. It also returns a CSV file and a pie chart for monitoring, analyzing and comparing the sentiments of the collected tweets.
