# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

It is a project that uses Twitter API and textblob module in order to parse tweets fetched from Twitter and apply sentiment analysis on the tweets. 
This project allows us to search for tweets using any keyword, language and location and returns a desired amount of tweets along with their sentiment.
